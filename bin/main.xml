			<employee id="scott-cowan" title="Scott Cowan" jobTitle="President, Strategy">
				<video src="" />
  <p><![CDATA[It is a long, uphill road from strategic Sandinista to El Presidente, but for the crowning majesty of The Great Society, Scott Cowan walked barefoot. In his lustrous career, Scott has sold popcorn door-to-door, gotten up at 4:00 AM for seven consecutive summers to pick strawberries and endured the drunken heckling of friends while working the graveyard shift as a busboy at Perkins Cake & Steak. More recently, Scott was partner, strategy & new business director at JohnsonCowanHanrahan, as well as a strategist at Wieden+Kennedy (Portland), Arnold (Boston), Publicis (Seattle) and elsewhere.
Scott has had the good fortune of working on some fantastic global accounts like Nike, Volkswagen, Amazon.com, Nestlé and many others. Scott is a relentlessly curious, multi-dimensional thinker who brings a holistic perspective to clients’ businesses. 
Recently, Scott and his family had the experience of a lifetime when they adopted <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/scott_tian.jpg">Tian</a></font>, a one-year-old girl from China. It was especially memorable because of the crowds his Mandarin-conversant five-year-old daughter <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="javascript:NewWindow=window.open('images/staff/scott_charlotte.mov','newWin','width=320,height=240,left=300,top=200,toolbar=No,location=No,scrollbars=No,status=No,resizable=No,fullscreen=No');NewWindow.focus(); void(0);">Charlotte</a></font> drew wherever she went.
Scott is also The Great Society’s reigning <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/scott_pingpong.jpg">table tennis champion</a></font>, having trounced the field in the Holiday Classic, thus raising the notoriety of The Great Society Table Tennis Association to unforeseen heights amongst table sport aficionados.

  <p><![CDATA[The pathway to The Great Society has been both divergent and meandering for Randall <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/randall_reed.jpg">Reed</a></font> Schoonover. Randall’s most humble beginnings on <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/randall_farm.jpg">a farm</a></font> near Molalla, Oregon, came to a crashing halt when his father, table tennis legend <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/randall_irwin.jpg">Irwin C. Schoonover</a></font>, auctioned off the acreage in the 80s. With a degree and little else in hand, Randall made his way to San Francisco, where he lived in fellow Society member Scott Cowan’s hallway closet for a short time.
There, like his <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/randall_grandpa.jpg">grandfather</a></font> before him, he practiced a variety of trades including parking valet, balloon delivery boy and gut-bucket rock guitarist before finding his way into art school and a career as an adman.
Nigel Williams, Randall’s first creative director at TBWA\Chiat\Day, still insists that he was so shorthanded that he swore he’d hire the next warm body that walked through the door. So began Randall’s six-year saga as an art director on the Nissan account. Years of freelance and Associate Creative Director roles at Foote Cone & Belding and JWT followed before Randall headed back to Portland, Oregon, and once again joined Scott Cowan at JohnsonCowanHanrahan.
Randall oversees all creative development at The Society and is himself a limitless source of challenging, provocative ideas. He has three fantastic children and an ancient yellow Lab named Victor and works tirelessly each day for the betterment of his clients' businesses and the shining glory of The Great Society.

  <p><![CDATA[Let the good deeds of The Great Society spread far and wide! A lifetime of <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/jen_passport.jpg">traveling</a></font>, makes Jen the perfect missionary for the Great Society. After school, she and a friend did that epic, yearlong, 18-country around-the-world pilgrimage that the rest of us kick ourselves for never having done. She’s also lived abroad in both Spain and <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/jen_inka.jpg">Peru</a></font>.        
Jen has worked both sides of the table in her career. She’s had marketing jobs at Oracle, Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group, Food.com and elsewhere. And she had a memorable run in account management at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners before moving to Portland and joining Scott and Randall to manage day-to-day Society operations and act as primary client liaison. 
Of all of us, Jen has the best last name, hands down. For that, she can thank her husband, Amir Tadjedin, a lawyer in town who helped in getting The Society started. The future of The Great Society is secure now that Jen is pregnant with the next generation of Societicians. This will be Jen and Amir’s second child – <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/jen_clementine.jpg">Clementine</a></font>, the sergeant at arms of Society security, was their first and would gladly risk life, limb and tail to protect the hallowed halls of The Great Society.

  <p><![CDATA[The benevolent voice of The Great Society beckoned Matt Warner who dutifully answered the call. Matt grew up in Anamosa, Iowa, which, in addition to a whole lot of farmers, is home to the <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/matt_fortress.jpg">“White Stone Fortress of the West.”</a></font> It is also the birthplace of Grant Wood, who painted this <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/matt_ditty.jpg">little ditty</a></font>. After Matt maximized the available local career opportunities detasseling corn, baling hay and delivering Domino's Pizza, he shipped out to college on an ROTC scholarship. Just weeks from flight school, where he was to learn to fly helicopters, Matt blew out his knee, thus necessitating career change #1. 
After <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/matt_unclesam.jpg">parting ways </a></font>with Uncle Sam, Matt worked briefly as a substitute teacher in Waterloo before meeting his future wife, which ultimately led to career change #2 (design) and a move to Portland. Once in the Rose City, Matt got married and did tours at Sandstrom Design, Wieden+Kennedy and Nike. Most recently, he was design director at Publicis (Seattle) where he created a design group from scratch.
Matt is a classic “big picture” kind of guy who enjoys thinking through all the different ways brands can be meaningfully experienced. He has done it all in his design career, for clients large (Nike, adidas, Microsoft, Miller Beer, T-Mobile) and small (you name it). 
When he’s not working, he’s usually playing with his three great kids <font color='#bc1b21'><a href="asfunction:_root.staffPic,images/staff/matt_kids.jpg">(Silas, Jack and Grace)</a></font> or Cooper, his flamboyant Rhodesian ridgeback. Through his righteous dedication and honorable stewardship, The Great Society and its clients are propelled to even greater triumphs and achievements.
